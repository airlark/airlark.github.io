The end of many groups

Intro

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ealier, and bigger part of hacking history normally had cons as their main thing. From the CCC in the 80's, to TESO in the
2000's, through LoD, MoD, cDc, L0pht, and a shitload more of well known groups, known and unknown. Most of hacking culture was
created, shaped, and immortalized by what they did, what they've wrote and their tools.

This "article" is about why recently, we havent seen any "hacker" groups anymore. But the ones we do see end up being retarded 
ransomware operators, and or larps. Andy why they haven't had much of the same type of cultural impact that the former ones had.

Background

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hacking overall is an underground movement. And the people that end up taking part of it have been the people who have (ab)used
electronics in ways that the knowlage of the mass had no idea about. Hacking has always been linked to insane efforts in finding
previously unknown information aswell as sharing it. This has been true ever since Computers barely had any users, up into the
huge world tech is today.

The character of the hacker interests has some shit difficulties. Learning knowlage on anything is hard, it requires a shitload
of research, experimenting and can turn into an endless journey if your objectives aern't set up right. Just like any other field
of scientific studies, it needs a huge ammount of colaboration, an attitude which, luckily for hackers, was greatly, greatly 
fucking helped by the creation of computer networks, and the most important, the internet.

Computer Networks, over time, made it easily possible to transmit unlimited and uncensored info to wherever they wanted, with 
little cost, and in virtually no time. From comms at a development standpoint, you would expect that the events that followed
the creation of the public internet to our current time, would lead into a huge expansion into Hacker communities. In effect,
hacking has grown to a huge ass size. Hacker communities? fuck no, definately not, so what the hell went wrong?

Current

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, nowadays we live in limited creativity. Although it may seem contradictory, it's pretty fuckin' rare for anything creative 
to arrise from groups or teams. Communities, rather then actual people, should be more intellectually empowered to create, but 
lately, the past few years, we've been seeing the age of the ego, where nobody wants to work together.

In "Time Wars" [1],  Mark Fisher explains that post-fordism has taken people to this shitty inability to think or innovate. Our 
nearly obsessivee need for work takes up not only our time, in the form of literal labor hours, but our minds, distracting us from
everything else we could be doing instead. These distractions include insane connections to media, I.E you checking discord every
5 seconds to see if your e-girl-femboy messsaged you back, or susan checking her yahoo! every 10 seconds to see if her grandkids
sent her any more cat pictures. There is also an increased concern with financial stability and provisioning, a convern that grows
as welfare is invariably trimmed by both governments, and the private sector too.

It is important to note that our capatalist "worries" sre more deeply rooted in us then it might seem at first, even in the most
politcally diverse people.  Supporting yourself and or someone else is not fucking easy, It doesent come for free. Getting education,
finding a job, staying up to date on whatever the fuck youre doing.

The unsettlement created in out thoughts affects intelectual solidarity in even more ways then in does individual creaetion. Simply
put, if it is already so difficult for one person to focus and get away from these distractions and into actually creating shit, 
let alone for a group to actually be collective and all work together. The ties that hold groups together takes a fuckload of 
dedication to actually build, and our egotistical concerns to not help (look at note A}. Not only is comitment required for actual
work to be done, but also to identify your shared values and goals that allow you to work together.

Notice this does not concern collaboration as much as it does collectivness. Collaboration normally breaks down the creative
processin a way it can easily be achieved with self sufficient and individualistic contributions. Such is the case in most
foss projects. Roles are very well segregated so that a minimum of human integration is required, as far as most modern software
development processes go, anyway. A true "Hive Mind" [2] cannot exist without someone actually telling others what to do. Funnily 
enough, the  popular variants of LOIC, the DDoS tool used by the retards known as "Anonymous", contain a "hive mind" feature {I.E.
getting a target automatically from a given IRC server and channel and firing your packets against it}. You wish it was that easy.

The concept of the "conscience collective" was the first established by Emile Durkheim who, in his 1983 book "The Division of Labor
in Society" said that the more primative societies are, the more resemblances there are to the people that made them. Inversely,
the more civilized a people, the more easily distinguishable its individual members', as put by R. Alun Jones [3].

Well, following (or despite) the shitty adoption of atheism and agnosticism as professed in the Internet and other popular
media, it is true that religous beleifs are in a low, taking a bit of what societies traditionally saw as a point of unity. infact,
theres a search thats growing in people day by day for uniqeness in the modern person, espeicially that from the apparently overpopulated
metropolises (see note B). In this  never ending crowd of interesting, "outstanding and amazing", personalities, we want to be
the one in a million, the one that gets seen, the one thats important.

Conclusion

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modern life nearly conspires against the collective, Everyone is constantly tormented by a never ending and relentless flow of 
information aswell as the faily worries of an eternally insecure, unwarrented life. Futhermore, we fucking hate this idea of
us being all alike, of sharing the same opinnions. As such, we are turning progressivly judgemental of who we should be 
partnering with, on the basis that "they do not understand". in hacking, it yet implicates on the delicate subject of trust,
which would require an essay on itself too. Given the undeniable importance the matter has aquired over the years.

If our thoughtd on creating hacker groups were to be summerized, this is how they would look: No one ever feels like we do.
They are not to be trusted and we dont have the time for them. The only attitude consonant to out search for a comfortable, safe
life is to constrain ourselves to our own limitations, ignore the intelligent life, out there, and surrender to the mediocracy
that our society has condemned our leisure time to.

notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) In respect to social networks, while they are a valid community-building
mechanism in nature, selfishness prevails in common usage, by means of the
indulgent pleasure that fuels chronic "pluggedness", at times voyeur, at
times exhibitionist and needy.

B) It is arguably the case, though, that the globalizing aspect of the
Internet has brought the feeling of upsetting commonality to the citizens
of even the more unpopulated places.
